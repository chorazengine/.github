Choraz Engine, an upcomming engine written fully in C++ and C, that takes a modern technology approach supporting latest technologies like DirectX 11 and 12, Vulkan and OpenGLES 3 or Vulkan for Mobile!<br>
Additionally you can both script and compile our own language Chorz for quick prototyping and production level speed, or visually develop your games with ease using ChorzBlocks.

### We're planning to support
- C++
- C#
- Rust
And on top of that languages like Chorz for simple scripting and fast prototyping.

## Our mission
We aim towards making a modern and feature packed engine that fits in recent times while being light weight and modular for everyone to extend and to easily maintain.<br>
