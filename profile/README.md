Choraz Engine, an upcomming engine written fully in C++ and C, that takes a modern technology approach supporting latest technologies like DirectX 11 and 12, Vulkan and OpenGLES 3 or Vulkan for Mobile!<br>
Additionally you can both script and compile our own language Chorz for quick prototyping and production level speed, or visually develop your games with ease using ChorzBlocks.

### We're planning to support
- Chorz and ChorzBlocks: Our in-house languages developed for speed both in development and execution!
- C++: If you want to get into the deep giddies of the engine and crank every bit of performance.
- C#: For the Unity bros, ofc ;)!
- Rust: No comment.

## Chorz/ChorzBlocks
Chorz and ChorzBlocks are our in-house languages that can both be interpretted realtime or compiled to our intermediate bytecode language to be executed everywhere at blazingly quick speeds!<br>
It allows for high-speeds and garbage collection, but also low level access and high customisability. You can even disable garbage collection and manage everything yourself.

Chorz is the most recommended language to be used with Choraz since it's got the highest level of support, can be switched back and forth from Chorz and ChorzBlocks to even visually write your code.

## Our mission
We aim towards making a modern and feature packed engine that fits in recent times while being light weight and modular for everyone to extend and to easily maintain.<br>
